# 🐭 wiggle: analyse mouse steering wheel data 🖱️ <img src="https://images.rawpixel.com/image_800/cHJpdmF0ZS9sci9pbWFnZXMvd2Vic2l0ZS8yMDIyLTA4L2pvYjk1Mi0wNTcteC5qcGc.jpg" width="25%" title="bombcell" alt="bombcell" align="right" vspace = "20">

In the International Brain Laboratory, mice perform a perceptual-decision making task and use a miniature Lego steering wheel to move a visual stimulus for a sugar reward. We show that mice wiggle the wheel as a strategy. Akin to humans shaking a computer mouse to find the cursor on a screen, mice use movement to build contrast when stimulus information is limited. The accuracy increases as wiggles increase in low visual contrast trials across N = 213 mice. 

wiggle provides code to reproduce this result.
